<h1>Physics</h1><h3>THE EXISTENCE OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES </h3><img src="https://assets-file/science/img/subatomic_particles.webp"/><p>In the field of Physics, there was a theory known as <b>‘Atomism’</b>. That <b>‘atom’</b> is the smallest part of matter, which cannot be divided. This theory was propounded by Democrats, the Greek, twenty-three centuries ago and it was also known to the Arabs and the Arabic word for atom, is <b>‘Zarra’</b>. But today, after science has advanced, we have come to know that though <b>‘atom’</b> is the smallest particle of matter, having the characteristic of the element, it yet can be divided into electrons, protons, etc. So people may think that the Qur'an is outdated. The Qur'an does speak about <b>‘Zarra’</b>, and says it’s a minute particle, but nowhere does it say that it cannot be divided.<br><br>In fact, the Qur'an says in Surah Sabah, Chapter No. 34, Verse No. 3, it says that:<br><br><i>“When the unbelievers say that the hour will never come tell them… it will surely come with the permission of the Lord who has the knowledge of the unseen, who has in His record, the minutest detail of an atom in the heaven and in the earth, and in His record is perspicuous things, smaller and greater than the <b>‘atom’</b>”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=34:3}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=34:3}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=34:3}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/34/3">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>So Qur'an says there are things smaller and greater than the atom. So Qur'an is not outdated… it is up to date.<br><br>A similar message is repeated in Surah Yunus, Chapter No. 10, Verse No. 61 that:<br><br><i>“In Allah's record is perspicuous things, smaller and greater than the atom.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=10:61}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=10:61}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=10:61}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/10/61">Open in reader</a></div></div>
