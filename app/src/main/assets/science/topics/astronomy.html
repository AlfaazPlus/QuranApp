<h1>Astronomy</h1><p>In the field of Astronomy if you ask a scientist that... how was our universe formed? How did it come into existence? He will tell you about the Big Bang Theory that initially the whole universe was one<b>‘Primary Nebula’</b>. Then there was a secondary separation which gave rise to galaxies, which further split to form things such as our solar system, which gave rise to planets, the Sun and the present Earth which we live in.</p><div class="toc"><div class="title">Table of contents</div><ul id="toc-ul" style="display:none"><li><a href="#big-bang">Creation of the universe: ‘The Big Bang’</a></li><li><a href="#gaseous-mass">There was an initial gaseous mass before the creation of galaxies</a></li><li><a href="#earth-shape">The spherical shape of the earth</a></li><li><a href="#moon-light">The light of the moon is reflected light</a></li><li><a href="#planets-rotation">The sun and planets rotate</a></li><li><a href="#solar-apex">The sun will extinguish after a certain period</a></li><li><a href="#expanding-universe">The expanding universe</a></li></ul></div><h3 id="big-bang">CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE: ‘THE BIG BANG’</h3><img src="https://assets-file/science/img/bigbang.webp"/><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=21:30}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=21:30}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=21:30}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/21/30">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>This verse of the Holy Qur'an speaks about the Big Bang Theory, in a nutshell.

If you ask a scientist, he will tell you that the universe before it was formed, the celestial matter, it was in the state of <b>‘gas’</b>, and the Arabic word <b>‘Dukhan’</b>which means Smoke, is more scientifically correct than mere <b>‘gas’</b>. And according to Stephen Hawkins, who is a very famous scientist, he said “the discovery of bridges of matter in the space is the biggest discovery of this century which gives us indisputable evidence of the creation, of the universe and the Big Bang Theory”.</p><hr><h3 id="earth-shape">THE SPHERICAL SHAPE OF THE EARTH</h3><img src="https://assets-file/science/img/earth_spherical_shape.webp"/><p>Previously the people thought that the world we live in, it is flat and they were afraid to venture too far, lest they would fall over. It was only in 1577, when Sir Francis Drake when he sailed around the earth he proved that the world was spherical.<br><br>The Qur'an mentions in Surah Luqman, Chapter No. 31, Verse 29:<br><br><i>“It is Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala, who merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=31:29}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=31:29}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=31:29}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/31/29">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>Merging is a slow and gradual process. The night slowly and gradually changes to day, and the day slowly and gradually changes to night. This phenomena is only possible if the shape of the earth is spherical, It’s not possible if it is flat. If it was flat there will be a sudden change.<br><br>The Qur'an says in Surah Az-Zumar, Chapter No. 39, Verse No. 5, it says:<br><br><i>“It is Allah who has created the heavens and the earth in true proportion and he overlaps and coils the night unto the day and overlaps or coils the day unto the night.</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=39:5}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=39:5}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=39:5}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/39/5">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Arabic word used is, <b>‘Kawwara’</b> which means overlapping or coiling.

This phenomena of the night overlapping and coiling over the day is only possible if the shape of the earth is spherical. It is not possible if the shape of earth is flat there will be a sudden change.</p><p>The Holy Qur'an further says in Surah Naziat, Chapter No. 79, Verse No. 30, it says:<br><br><i>“And thereafter We have made the earth egg-shaped.” </i><sup>1</sup></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=79:30}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=79:30}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=79:30}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/79/30">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Arabic word <b>‘Dahaha’</b> comes from root word <b>‘Duhya’</b>, meaning an Egg-shape and it does not refer to any normal Egg. It specifically refers to the Egg of an Ostrich and today we know that the world is not completely round like a ball, it is Geo Spherical. It is slightly flattened from the top and bulging from the centre, it’s Geo Spherical. And if you analyze the shape of the Egg of an Ostrich - it too is Geo Spherical, slightly flattened from the top and bulging from the centre. So the Holy Qur'an describes the exact <b>‘Geo Spherical earth’</b>1400 years ago.</p><div class="note"><sup>1</sup> The Arabic word <b>‘Dahaha’</b> has been translated by A.

It was known as the theory of 'Geocentrism'. It was believed by Ptolemy in the second century BC, and was believed till as late as 16th century, until Copernicus said that the Earth and the planets revolve around the Sun. And later on, in 1609 Yuhanas Kepler wrote in his book, ‘Astronomia Nova’ … that not only do the earth and the planets revolve around the Sun, they also rotate about their own axis.<br><br>Previously it was taught that the Sun was fixed, it did not rotate about its own axis.<br><br>But the Holy Qur'an says in Surah Al-Anbiya, Chapter No. 21, Verse No. 33:<br><br><i>“It is Allah who has created the night and the day”</i><br><i>“The Sun and the Moon”</i><br><i>“Each one traveling in a orbit, with its own motion.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=21:33}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=21:33}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=21:33}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/21/33">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Arabic word <b>‘Yasbahoon’</b>, is derived from the word <b>‘Sabaha’</b>, which describes the motion of a moving body. If I say that a man is doing <b>‘Sabaha’</b> on the ground, it will not mean that he is rolling, it will mean he is either walking or running. If I say a person is doing <b>‘Sabaha’</b> in the water, it will not mean he is floating, it will mean he is swimming. Similarly, when the Qur'an uses the word <b>‘Yasbahoon’</b> derived from<b>‘Sabaha’</b>, for a celestial body it will not mean… it is flying, it will mean, it is rotating about its own axis. And today we have come to know with the help of an equipment, we can have the image of the Sun on the table top, and we see there are black spots and it takes approximately 25 days for these black spots to complete one rotation indicating that the Sun takes approximately 25 days to complete one rotation.<br><br>Can you imagine the Qur'an speaks about the rotation and the revolution of the Sun 1400 years ago, which science has discovered today.<br><br>The Holy Qur'an says in Surah Yasin, Chapter No. 36, Verse No. 40:<br><br><i>“It is not permitted for the Sun to catch up with the Moon, nor the night to outstrip the day…</i><br><i>… each one travelling in an orbit with its own motion”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=36:40}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=36:40}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=36:40}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/36/40">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>What does the Qur'an mean by saying it is not permitted for the Sun to catch up with the Moon... previously people thought that the orbit of the Sun and the Moon was the same.

The question of catching up does not arise and each of them, the Sun and the Moon, they rotate as well as revolve.</p><hr><h3 id="solar-apex">THE SUN WILL EXTINGUISH AFTER A CERTAIN PERIOD</h3><p>The Qur'an says in Surah Yasin, Chapter No. 36, Verse No. 38:<br><br><i>“The Sun is running its course to a place determined, for a period determined” </i><sup>3</sup></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=36:38}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=36:38}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=36:38}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/36/38">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Arabic word, <b>‘Mustakar’</b>, means to a place determined, for a period determined.
