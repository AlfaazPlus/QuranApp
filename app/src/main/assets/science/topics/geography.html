<h1>Geography</h1><h3>THE WATER CYCLE</h3><img src="https://assets-file/science/img/water_cycle.webp"/><p>In the field of Geography, we learn in school about the coherent water cycle. This was first described by Sir Bernard Palissy, in 1580. And he said how does water evaporate from the ocean, form clouds, the cloud move in the interior how do they fall as rain, the rain water flows into the ocean and the cycle is completed.<br><br>Previously people thought in the 7th century BC Thales of Miletus he said that “the spray of the ocean was picked up by the wind and it fell into the interior as rain”. People did not know... how did the underground water... the springs, where did they come from. So they thought that due to the pressure of the winds on the water, the thrust of the winds on the water - it fell into the interior as rain, and this rain water seeped into the soil, and returned to the ocean through a secret passage, <b>‘the Abyss’</b>which was known at the time of the Plato as <b>‘Tartarus’</b>. People believed in this theory of Descartes, even till as late as 17th century. And philosophers like Aristotle's theory was believed till as late as 19th century, that water vapor evaporated from the soil, it condensed in mountain caverns, and these mountain caverns formed lakes which fed the spring water.<br><br>Today we know that the underground water, the springs, it is due to the seepage of the rain water. And the Qur'an says that in Surah Al-Zumur, Chapter No. 39, Verse No. 21:<br><br><i>“Seest thou not that it is Allah who sends down rain from the sky, and seeps it in the sources in the ground, in the springs in the earth, and causes sown seed of various colours to grow.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=39:21}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=39:21}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=39:21}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/39/21">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The message is repeated in Surah Rum Chapter No. 30, Verse No. 24:<br><br><i>“Allah sends down rain and the dead earth… brings it back to life.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=30:24}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=30:24}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=30:24}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/30/24">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Qur'an says in Surah Muminun, Chapter No. 23, Verse No 18, that:<br><br><i>“It is Allah who sends down rain in due measure, We are able to store it, and We are also able to easily drain it.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=23:18}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=23:18}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=23:18}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/23/18">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Qur'an says in Surah Al-Hijr, Chapter No. 15, Verse No 22, it says that:<br><br><i>“We send fecundating winds, winds impregnating, and cause rain to descend from the sky, and give you water in due measure.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=15:22}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=15:22}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=15:22}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/15/22">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Arabic word 'Lawaaqi' used here, is the plural of 'Laqi' derived from <b>‘Laqaha’</b>which means to impregnate or to fecundate. The winds carrying the pollen they impregnate the cloud, and then rain falls. The wind causes the clouds to merge... there is condensation, there is lightning and rain falls from the clouds.<br><br>The Qur'an describes the complete water cycle, how does the water evaporate, how it forms clouds, how it moves in the interior, how it falls down, how it flows back into the ocean in several places.</p><ul><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/24/43">In Surah Nur, Chapter No. 24, Verse No. 43...</a></li><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/78/12-14">In Surah Naba, Chapter No. 78, Verse No 12 to 14, as well as...</a></li><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/30/48">In Surah Rum, Chapter No. 30, Verse No 48.</a></li></ul><p>The Holy Qur'an says in Surah Nur, Chapter No. 24, Verse No 43, that:<br><br><i>“We send mountain masses of clouds.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=24:43}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=24:43}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=24:43}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/24/43">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>What does the Qur'an mean by saying, We send mountain masses of clouds? Today if anyone has been traveling in an Aeroplane, he will realize that when the Aeroplane goes above the clouds, and he looks at the clouds beneath, he will see that the clouds appear as mountain masses. The Qur'an has said this 1400 years ago. There wasn't a Aeroplane 1400 years ago.
