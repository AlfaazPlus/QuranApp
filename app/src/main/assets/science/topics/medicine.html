It is the bee which is responsible for the honey. We did not know about this before. And today we know honey has got high nutritive values. It is rich in vitamin K, and Fructose and it has got mild antiseptic properties. No wonder the Russian soldiers, they used honey to cover up their wounds which prevented the evaporation of moisture and left very little scar tissue. Any person suffering from an allergy of a particular plant, if honey produced from that plant is given, that person starts developing resistance to that allergy.</p>
