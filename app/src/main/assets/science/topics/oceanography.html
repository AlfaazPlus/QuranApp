<h1>Oceanography</h1><h3>BARRIER BETWEEN SWEET AND SALT WATERS</h3><p>In the field of <b>‘Oceanology’</b>, the Holy Qur'an says in Surah Furqan, Chapter No. 25, Verse No. 53:<br><br><i>“It is Allah who has let free two bodies of flowing water one sweet and palpable and the other salt and bitter, and between them there is a <b>‘Barzakh’</b>, a barrier, which is forbidden to be trespassed.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=25:53}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=25:53}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=25:53}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/25/53">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Qur'an repeats the message in Surah Rahman, Chapter No. 55, Verse No. 19 and 20:<br><br><i>“It is Allah who has let free two bodies of flowing water which meet and between them there is a barrier which is forbidden to be trespassed.”ss</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=55:19}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=55:19}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=55:19}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/55/19">Open in reader</a></div></div><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=55:20}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=55:20}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=55:20}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/55/20">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Arabic word <b>‘Barzakh’</b> means <b>‘a barrier’</b> and the Arabic statement… <i>“Marajal Bahraini yaltaqiyaan”</i> … means <b>‘the flowing bodies of water, they meet and mixs’</b>. Previously the commentators, they could not understand the two opposite descriptions of the two bodies of flowing water. It says, <b>‘they meet and mix’</b>, as well as it says… <b>‘there is a barrier between them’</b>. The commentator of the Qur'an could not understand, explain, what did this verse actually mean, it was confusing. Today we have come to know, with the help of science, that there is a slanting barrier between the two bodies of salt water and sweet water... between the salt sea and the sweet sea. And whenever water passes from one sea to the other sea, it loses its characteristics and gets homogenized into the water it flows. There is a barrier but this barrier is called as <b>‘a transitional homogenizing space or area’</b>.<br><br>Both the waters though they meet and mix, but their characteristics yet remain the same. Salt water remains salt, the sweet water remains sweet... and this phenomena can be seen in Cape Point, southernmost tip of South Africa, in Cape Town - where salt and sweet water meet, but they are distinct... they don't mix. When they flow across, the water changes it is characteristics. Similar things can be observed in Egypt, when river Nile flows into the Mediterranean Sea. As well as the example of the Gulf stream, which starts in the Gulf of Mexico though it flows for thousands of miles, both the water, salt and sweet water, they are distinct. And if you are traveling in a boat, and if you pick up water from one side of the boat and water from the other side, you will find that both the waters are different. One is sweet and the other is salty. Even the temperature differs. Even in the area of Gibraltar, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean ocean, there is an unseen barrier, and this was confirmed. This phenomena which the Qur'an speaks about, was confirmed by Professor Hay, who is a leading marine of USA.<br><br>The Qur'an asks the people, that “which of the favours of thy Lord will you deny”. In Surah Rehman itself, Chapter No. 55, this verse… <i>“then which of the favours of your Lord will you deny?”…</i> is repeated no less than thirty-one times. It speaks about the signs of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala, about trees, about the heavens, and then asks you… “then which of the signs of your Lord will you deny?” It speaks about the water cycle and then asks you… ”then which of the signs of thy Lord will you deny?”…It speaks about the barrier between the sweet and the salt water, and then asks you… “which of the signs, of thy Lord will you deny?” The Qur'an in one Chapter itself, it is asking its reader… ‘Which of the signs of God Almighty, will you people deny? It is prodding you that all these signs, from where do they come? which is the signs you will deny?</p>
